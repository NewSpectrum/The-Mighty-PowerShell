# The-Mighty-PowerShell

Once I actually make one, this README is going to be __*awesome.*__

In the interim, however, please enjoy this photo I took. Everybody, I would like you to meet my mother's kitten, Strype.

Strype is very tired though, so maybe he'll meet you later. Though, while kitten-greetings are up in the air, a *viveting* README document is on the way. ðŸ˜Ž
